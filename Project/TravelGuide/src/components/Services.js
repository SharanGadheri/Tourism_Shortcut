    <p>Houseboat Altaf offers 4-star accommodations with a terrace and Jacuzzi along the pristine ghats of Dal Lake near Nehru Park. Carpeted floors, ethnic linens and dining halls add to the glam interior.
    This may range from full silver service in a fine dining restaurant, where the dishes are served at the table by waiters with service spoons and forks, to a self-service cafeteria where guests collect their own food from the counter
